🚀 Just launched: Gemini Vibe Station ✦

I built a "God-Tier" Agent Template Library in just 2 hours using Google Antigravity. ⚡️

Stop writing boilerplate prompts. Start Vibe Coding.

What is it?
A curated collection of structured, enterprise-grade specs for AI Agents. These aren't just text prompts—they are typed JSON objects with:
✅ Explicit System Roles
✅ Execution Phases
✅ Verification Steps
✅ Typed Inputs

Why?
Because "chatting" with AI is slow. Giving it a structured Spec is instant engineering.

The Tech Stack (Vibe Coded):
*   Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind v4 (Google Light Theme 🎨)
*   Backend: Firebase Firestore
*   DevOps: GitOps Workflow (Merge PR -> Auto-Sync to DB)
